This section is for "containing" a PoD that has been compromised.
It relies on marking a PoD with a specific label (this could be done manually or via Ansible for example - using the oc client command).
In this example, it relies on the label contained = true
ACM does two things:

 - 1/ applies a network policy for deny all to all namespaces (block-all-network-policy.yaml) 
 - 2/ ACM defines a policy that "searches" for such PoD throughout the cluster(s). Based on whether we want this policy to show as "red" or "green" there are 2 options (e.g musthave vs. mustnothave).

All the files are presented in this git repo.
